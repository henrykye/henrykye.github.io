## About

As a passionate entrepreneur, I'm embarking on a mission to empower Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to harness the power of Digital Transformation. I believe that every business deserves access to cutting-edge resources, and I'm committed to helping SMEs overcome the common barriers that hinder their growth.

In addition, I'm a **Quantitative Economist** enthusiastic of exploring casual problems with scientific rigors; **Data Scientist** supporting a data-driven decision making system in business and research operation; **R/Shiny Developer** writing interactive web apps focused on data-centered business and research projects.
